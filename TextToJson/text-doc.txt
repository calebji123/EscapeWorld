#All whitespaces are cleared at the beginning and end of an item
#| is an invisible character that stops whitespace clearing
#\ is an invisible character that clears the speciality of the characters after it.
#optional things can be omitted
#to bypass an optional parameter: Word >> Hey >> >> false
#parameters are lowercase. Modlets are capitalized
#extra new lines and tabs are ignored. 
#code is delineated based ;\n, but not for tags (cause it looks nicer)
#content can be split into multiple lines, but the \n and \t should be erased. <br> creates a newline in a content
#all parameters are before tile/module/modlets
#parameters should not have to be ordered
#parameters can 

#doc parameters
title >> content
areas >> list[content] #comma separated list. Whitespaces front and back cleared, but not in-between. 
colors >> list[colors] #comma separated list. Colors written in hex.
nolocal #default local. If nolocal, every isLocal in submit is set to null by default. if notlocal, every islocal is set to false by default 

#tile parameters
start #only one tile can have start. Sets this to start. default is not set to start
area >> number; #element of areas list
direction >> code >> locked; #locked optional. locked specifies lock - true. default lock false

#text parameters
locked #makes it locked

#input parameters
locked #makes it locked
unlock >> options >> more options >> etc; 
#options are formatted as CODE-CODE. The first code designates the start. Alone, it unlocks all paths from that tile.
#CODE-number unlocks the # number module in CODE
#CODE-CODE unlocks the singular connection between CODE and CODE

#modlets
#all modlets follow the formula: 
name >> answer/contents >> parameters; 
#Text modlets
Title >> content;
Para >> content;
Dia >> speaker >> content;
#input modlets
Word >> answer >> placeholder >> oneword; #oneWord states if it is restricted to one word, default false. placeholder default is none. 
Char >> answer >> placeholder; #placeholder default is none
Col >> answer >> start >> col_list; #start default at 0, col list default at colors doc parameter.
Submit >> name >> notlocal; #name default at "submit", second parameter either local/notlocal/nolocal
